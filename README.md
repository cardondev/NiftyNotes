# NiftyNotes
yet another application that organizes  bookmarks, notes, and keys for personal use.  

Why?
I needed something simple yet effective for personal use, and that's how this little project started. No fancy downloads, no installations, just a straightforward tool that can run from a local computer. No internet? No problem. I wanted something portable, easy to manage, and secure enough for personal use, without any extra software or third-party dependencies. 

# What's under the hood?
The application is built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. All styling and animations are accomplished using native CSS functionalities, and JavaScript handles the business logic and local storage management. No external libraries or frameworks are used, making the application lightweight and fast.

# Who's It For?
Well, it's for me, and anyone else who wants a straightforward tool for managing bookmarks, notes, and keys. It's a simple, local, and no-frills way to stay a bit more organized.

# How to Use?

Download the Files: Download the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from this repo. Keep them in a single folder so everything runs smoothly.

Local Storage: Make sure your browser supports local storage (Chrome works best), as that's where all your entries will be saved. And don't worry, once the app is up, you can use it offline.

Open the App: Just double-click on the index.html file to open it in your browser. This will serve as your home page, from which you can navigate to the notes, bookmarks, and keys sections.

Navigation: There are links and icons at the top of each page for easy navigation. Use these to switch between the different sections or to return to the home page.

Adding Entries: Each section has designated fields for entering your data. Fill these out and click "Add" to save your entries.

Deleting Entries: hit the delete button and it's gone forever.

Save to a local file: Honesly, I got a bit lazy towards the end and just created a function to save locally and upload them back up. Make sure to refresh the page after uploading the json file. I gotta fix that in the next release.
